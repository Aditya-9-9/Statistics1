        "\n",
        "14.How does the Central Limit Theorem relate to the normal distribution?\n",
        " - The CLT states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean becomes approximately normal as the sample size\n",
        "n increases, regardless of the population’s original shape (skewed, uniform, etc.), as long as the population has a finite mean and variance.\n",
        " - This means that even if the population is not normally distributed, the distribution of the sample means will be normal for large\n",

        "\n",
        "18.What is the significance of confidence intervals in statistical analysis/\n",

        "19.What is the relationship between a Z-score and a confidence interval?\n",
        " - The Z-score and confidence interval (CI) are closely related because the Z-score determines the width (margin of error) of a confidence interval when using the standard normal distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "20.How are Z-scores used to compare different distributions?\n",
        " - Different distributions may be on different scales (e.g., test scores out of 100 vs. 200).\n",
        " - A Z-score standardizes the data, converting it into a common scale measured in standard deviations from the mean.\n",
        " - This allows direct comparison across distributions.\n",
        "\n",
        "21.What are the assumptions for applying the Central Limit Theorem/\n",
        " - The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is powerful, but it relies on some key assumptions to hold true. These assumptions ensure that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will approximate a normal distribution.\n",

        " - Independence\n",
        "\n",
        "22.What is the concept of expected value in a probability distribution?\n",
        " - The expected value (also called the mean or expectation) of a probability distribution is the long-term average value you would expect if you repeated a random experiment many times. It represents the \"center\" or the average outcome of the distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "23.How does a probability distribution relate to the expected outcome of a random variable?\n",
        " - The probability distribution defines the likelihood of each outcome.\n",
